     This word cloud shows the words from the song <em>"6 God"</em> by Drake.<br>
    I made this website for a data structures class at Brooklyn College.<br>
	The song used in this project is called <em>"6 God"</em> by the greatest rapper, Drake. <br>
	The purpose of this project is to develop and at the same time practice important<br>
	skills that are used in a daily basis. There are three parts to this project that <br>
	teaches useful skills for the work force:<br>
	<br>
<h1>1.</h1>	Experimenting different Data Structures: After choosing the song, each individual <br>
	had the right to choose which ever data structure they wanted. Our job was to write a<br> 
	Java code that can count the unique words of the song from a file. This was great practice<br>
	because we had to implement the data structure to print out the frequencies at the end.  <br>
	The data structure I use is called Hash Map. Hash Map is a map based collection class that<br>
	is used for storing data. Its main purpose is to store values based on key that can be access<br>
	whenever the programmer chose to. I guess one advantage is that when we add things to the hash map<br>
	order is not followed but in this project that is not necessary. However there are classes like <br>
	<em>"Linked Hash Map"</em> that is able to maintain input order. This part was challenging but fun.<br>
	<br>
 <h1>2.</h1> Data Visualization with Open Source: With the frequency list generated at the end<br>
    we had to create an image. A word cloud was created using an open source library called <em>"KUMO"</em>.<br> 
	We had to do some research to see how the <em>"KUMO"</em> library works. The expected output is located <br>
	underneath the song title at the top pf the page. That was great practice on using other libraries <br>
	that we had never use before. This shows me that learning the basics of Java is not enough and by <br>
	doing some research we can growth our Java library mindset. 
<h1>3.</h1>	Website: using GitHub as our server we had to put a website together that shows our work<br>
    at the end. I used NotePad++ to code my website. This was the best part of the assignment because<br> 
	I learn how to publish my website through GitHub.<br>
	<br>
    For this assignment we had roughly 3 weeks to finish. Looking at my website I can tell you that I would<br>
    like to put links that take me to another page. For example we had to print he frequency list on another <br>
	file. I would like to use that file and make it its own page. For the song information I would like it have<br>
	its own page. Don’t get me wrong because working a full time job and going to school cuts my time in half <br>
	and I’m also trying to have my own time. After all this project was a nice way of looking at many different <br>
	paths a Computer Science Bachelor’s degree can open.<br>
<br>

    <h2>Why did you choose this particular song?</h2>

<p>
	I remember when Drake first debuted he only had 2 albums back them but he was already making history. <br>
	Well-being that popular made him a target. He was working on future projects when he suffer a hack attack.<br> 
	On October 2014 in order to clap back at hackers he released a couple of songs.<em>"6 God"</em>, <em>"How Bout Now"</em> and<br>
	<em>"Heat of the Moment"</em>. At that time I had a part time job at CHIPOTLE and I use to take the 6 train to 33rd St.<br>
	The whole album just made me keep on going because I was going to tough times. It was an escape from reality, <br>
	that 20 minute ride to work was my time to relax and get ready for whatever Chipotle and the world decides to throw at me.<br>
	</p>
<h2>Was the song ever a billboard top hit? When?</h2>
<p>
    “Drake's surprise album if you’re Reading this It's Too Late blasts in at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart as expected,<br>
    easily scoring the hip-hop star his fourth chart-topper.” <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6473126/billboard-200-drake-surprise-album-debuts-at-no-1-fifty-shades" style="color:black"> (Source)</a>
</p>
 <h2>What were the top words found? Was it a surprise?</h2>
<p>
    The top words found in the <em>"6 God"</em>. by drake was: the, I, you, boy, I’m, admit. This is not surprising because the <br>
	whole song it’s him saying that he puts money first, he knows how to play the game, and that even though he is new <br>
	to the rap industry, he knows his way around because he used to be an actor so dont underestimate him.<br>
	</p>
	
<h2>Can you find the value of each word? Of the top words? This would involve researching sales and calculating price per word.</h2>
